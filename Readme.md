# Introduction

GitHub is a service in the field of maintaining and versioning source codes. We intend to interact with this service by using the programming interfaces and extract the information of a user. A background spans the entire screen with a transparent rectangle in the middle. The middle rectangle should contain all your displayable content. What is displayed on the left side of the screen is the information of a user that is extracted through programming interfaces. This information includes the user's picture, the user's full name, the user's blog address, and the user's place of residence.
Finally, after this, the user's bio information is displayed in a box.
